Sainsburys Technical Questions.

Utilising the chef knife command:

a. knife create node1.

The accompanying JSON:

"json_class":  "Chef: Node",
"chef_type": "node
"default_attributes" : {
"nginz" : {
...
"run_list": [
"recipe [nginx]",
"role [webserver]"
],

}

knife create node2

The accompanying JSON:

"json_class":  "Chef: Node",
"chef_type": "node"
"default_attributes" : {
"jboss" : {
...
"run_list": [
"recipe [jboss]",
"role [appserver]"
],
}

knofe create node3

I will assume the 2 app servers are JBoss.

The accompanying JSON:

"json_class":  "Chef: Node",
"chef_type": "node"
"default_attributes" : {
"jboss" : {
...
"run_list": [
"recipe [jboss]",
"role [appserver]"
],
}
}

The b Question:

knife ssh -x ade chef_environment:DEV1 AND role:DeployApp
"sudo -u root chef-client -l info"

(The role DeployApp is defined in a chef cookbook)

{
"name": "DeployApp",
"json_class" : "Chef::Role",
"chef_type": "role",
"run_list": [
"recipe (jboss:: deployjboss)"
]
env_run_lists": {
}
...
}


Recipe for the nginx deploy:

{
"name": "Nginx",
"json_class" : "Chef::Role",
"chef_type": "role",
"run_list": [
"recipe (nginx:: deployNginx)"
]
env_run_lists": {
}
...
}

deployNginx would contain the nginx deploy command. It could be "wget http://...nginx" and then include the Balancer directives to round robin between the 2 application servers.

I would us the chef foodcritic command against the cookbook containing the deployNginx to test the round robin.


Concerning the sample code:

I would introduce variables, resources and operations;

action, run, execute.

The execute operation will be able to  give the response "Hi there, I'm served from <application node hostname>"
Hostname is the hostname of the linux server serving the requests at a point in time.

To share my work on a public git repo:

I create my README.rd in my local drectory to include with the other cookbooks in mmy local director

Then type:
